Manchester United's start to the season has been challenging, with one win and one loss. The victory over Wolves included a controversial penalty decision that caused Simon Hooper and Michael Salisbury to be demoted. The loss to Spurs also featured questionable calls, including a missed handball that could have resulted in the first goal for United.

Amidst this drama, the match against Nottingham Forest appeared as a favorable opportunity â€“ a game against a team often predicted by pundits and analysts to be contenders in the relegation battle.  I was cautiously happy to see Eriksen in the midfield, while wishing Mount a speedy recovery! 

<h2>Match Facts</h2>

Manchester United used a 4-3-3 formation against Nottingham Forest's 3-4-3, but Forest's counterattacking approach often saw them holding a 5-4-1 defensive setup. Their main strategy revolved around playing a long ball to Awoniyi. United dominated possession with 67%. Leveraging their possession, United orchestrated a comeback by generating around 18 shots, with 9 of them on target. Their expected goals (xG) stood at 2.91, surpassing Forest's 1.24.

<h2>First Forest Goal</h2>

The opening goal originated from a United corner. After the ball was cleared, AWB lost the header, leaving a gap for Awoniyi to exploit with his run. Rashford, who is one of the league's fastest players, appeared somewhat sluggish in his recovery. His half-hearted challenge led to a loss of balance, affecting his speed.

Additionally, there's room for improvement in Onana's positioning; he could have potentially stepped up when Rashford caught up to Awoniyi to cut the angle down. Overall, while there were multiple factors contributing to the goal, it ultimately resulted from unfortunate circumstances and Rashford not reacting swiftly enough to the danger. I would argue that Rashford should not be in this position at all. Martinez isn't the best in the air and he should be marshalling the second balls while AWB should be the last covering defender.

<h2>Second Forest Goal</h2>

The second goal was a set piece situation where the ball struck Boly's head and found the net. While our defenders could have done better in this scenario, it's likely that across the span of a 38-game season, most teams are bound to concede unfortunate goals at some point.

<h2>First United Goal</h2>

The United comeback initiated with a shot from Bruno from around 20 yards away, which the keeper saved. Martial collected the rebound and passed it to Rashford. In the process, Boly, who was marking Martial, was moving away from the goal. This left Rashford with a 1-on-1 opportunity against Aurier, who accelerated to the dead ball line and delivered a powerful left-footed low cross, seeking a target. Fortunately, Eriksen made a well-timed near-post run and managed to slot it in.

<h2>Second United Goal</h2>

This is one of my favorite set piece strategies. Bruno shapes up for a cross but instead plays it to Rashford, who is unmarked on the opposite side. At this point, either the striker who is left up top for counter attack will press Rashford or the last man in Forest's defensive line will step up as he is closest to him. But Martial keeps the last man busy by making a far post run.

This pass forces every single player to turn to the other side, which disrupts the shape a little for Forest but also allows for blindside runs by the set piece taker, Bruno, who makes a well-timed run. Rashford puts in a peach of a cross, and Bruno heads it down for Casemiro to score.

<h2>Third United Goal</h2>

Rashford once again drives to the dead ball line and is brought down by the Forest player, leading to a penalty which Bruno calmly tucks away.

<h2>Midfield worked better</h2>

The heatmap below highlights where players were most active on the field. The heatmap for Bruno against Forest might be a bit misleading. However, Bruno mainly operated from the right side, aiding Antony who had a notably improved performance. United earned 11 corners, with Bruno often taking them. We also played a more short corners which is why Bruno's heatmap looks like that. Certainly, the heatmap unmistakably illustrates Bruno's positioning on the right side during the match against Forest. In contrast, his distribution across both sides was more balanced in the game against Wolves.

Casemiro also was more central and deeper against Forest than he was against Wolves.

Eriksen's impact was instrumental in achieving this setup. In the Wolves match, Mount's positioning appeared scattered, whereas Eriksen's positioning against Forest was notably left-oriented. He seamlessly shifted into a central role when Bruno occupied the right side. His touches were primarily outside the box, indicating his role in distributing play. Eriksen's controlled ball movement facilitated team involvement and cohesion.

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

I was considerably pleased with this midfield trio, and the game exhibited better-controlled possession. Our ball retention also improved significantly, with Antony displaying better composure under possession. Notably, both Antony and Rashford actively attempted crosses, with Antony's right-footed cross creating a noteworthy chance. 

Eriksen's role as a number 8 appears well-suited for matches against teams employing deep defensive blocks. However, his defensive vulnerabilities might make him a less ideal choice against top 6 opponents. It's evident that we are in dire need of a defensively adept number 8 who possesses speed, strength, and good passing range.

I believe Forest were not prepared to be up 2 goals within 5 minutes at Old Trafford and weren't prepared to defend for the rest of the game. However, we cannot end up in this situation against teams like West Ham, Brentford etc. who are great at sustaining pressure for long periods of time.
