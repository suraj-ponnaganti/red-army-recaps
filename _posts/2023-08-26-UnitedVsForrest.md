Manchester United's start to the season has been challenging, with one win and one loss. The victory over Wolves included a controversial penalty decision that caused Simon Hooper and Michael Salisbury to be demoted. The loss to Spurs also featured questionable calls, including a missed handball that could have resulted in the first goal for United.

Amidst this drama, the match against Nottingham Forest appeared as a favorable opportunity â€“ a game against a team often predicted by pundits and analysts to be contenders in the relegation battle.  I was cautiously happy to see Eriksen in the midfield, while wishing Mount a speedy recovery! 

<h2>Match Facts</h2>

Manchester United adopted a 4-3-3 formation against Nottingham Forest's 3-4-3, but Forest's counterattacking approach often saw them transition into a 5-4-1 setup. Their main strategy revolved around playing a long ball to Awoniyi. United dominated possession with 67%. Leveraging their possession, United orchestrated a comeback by generating around 18 shots, with 9 of them on target. Their expected goals (xG) stood at 2.91, surpassing Forest's 1.24.

<h2>First Forest Goal</h2>

The opening goal originated from a United corner. After the ball was cleared, AWB lost the header, leaving a gap for Awoniyi to exploit with his run. Rashford, who is one of the league's fastest players, appeared somewhat sluggish in his response. His challenge led to a loss of balance, affecting his speed.

Additionally, there's room for improvement in Onana's positioning; he could have potentially stepped up when Rashford caught up to Awoniyi. Overall, while there were multiple factors contributing to the goal, it ultimately resulted from unfortunate circumstances and Rashford not reacting swiftly enough to the danger.

<h2>Second Forest Goal</h2>

The second goal was a set piece situation where the ball struck Boly's head and found the net. While our defenders could have performed better in this scenario, it's important to acknowledge that across the span of a 38-game season, most teams are bound to concede unfortunate goals at some point.

<h2>First United Goal</h2>

The United comeback initiated with a shot from Bruno from around 20 yards away, which the keeper saved. Martial collected the rebound and passed it to Rashford. In the process, Boly, who was marking Martial, was moving away from the goal. This left Rashford with a 1-on-1 opportunity against Aurier, who accelerated to the dead ball line and delivered a powerful left-footed low cross, seeking a target. Fortunately, Eriksen made a well-timed near-post run and managed to slot it in.

<h2>Second United Goal</h2>

This is one of my favorite set piece strategies. Bruno shapes up for a cross but instead plays it to Rashford, who is unmarked on the opposite side. The only real threat is the last man for Forest, but Martial keeps him busy by making a far post run.

This pass forces every single player to turn to the other side, which disrupts the shape a little for Forest but also allows for blindside runs by the set piece taker, Bruno, who makes a well-timed run. Rashford puts in a peach of a cross, and Bruno heads it down for Casemiro to score.

<h2>Third United Goal</h2>

Rashford once again drives to the dead ball line and gets brought down by the Forest player, leading to a penalty which Bruno calmly tucks away.

<h2>Midfield worked better</h2>
