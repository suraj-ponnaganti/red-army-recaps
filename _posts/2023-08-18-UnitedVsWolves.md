I was absolutely certain before the game that United would secure an easy victory, especially considering Wolves' challenges last year and the absence of their main creator, Ruben Neves. But, I couldn't have been more mistaken. United did manage a 1-0 win in the end and that is what matters.

United did maintain a slightly higher possession rate at 54%, yet struggled to make significant progress with it, registering a 1.45 expected goals (xG) compared to Wolves' 2.15. Notably, Wolves outperformed United in the tackle department, winning 23 tackles compared to United's 18. Interestingly, while Wolves tackled more, they also committed 5 fewer fouls than United. While this might not hold substantial significance, it could suggest late challenges, indicating a potential lack of match sharpness.

<h2>The set up</h2>

In the in-possession phase, the visual representation illustrates Martinez and AWB (although not visible) maintaining wide positioning, while Varane advances towards the upper defensive third to engage the Wolves' striker. Concurrently, Shaw drops into midfield to adopt an inverted role. If we follow the sequence, the ball is played to Martinez and Shaw rapidly shifts out wide to receive the pass from Martinez. I find myself uncertain about the rationale behind this tactical approach. During this situation, Garnacho didn't drop back to occupy the space left open by Shaw. Shaw's inverted positioning also failed to create room for either Bruno or Mount to drop back into the defensive third. Personally, I would lean towards a different strategy, with Shaw maintaining a wide position while either Mount or Bruno drops deeper into the midfield area. This configuration might offer more versatility and exploit available spaces more effectively.

Switching to our out-of-possession strategy, our pressing approach involves strategically positioning our three forward players between Wolves' central midfielders and defenders. This strategic setup forces the ball being wide. Upon such a ball movement, our entire team shifts their positioning to apply pressure on that side and disrupt the opposition's progression, often leading to the ball being played back to the goalkeeper or a turnover in possession. This tactical maneuver effectively creates numerical overloads and defensive pressure, a fundamental element of our defensive strategy.
