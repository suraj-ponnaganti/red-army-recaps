title: "Manchester United vs Wolves - A 1-0 win that feels like a loss"
date: 2023-08-18

I was absolutely certain before the game that United would secure an easy victory, especially considering Wolves' struggles last year and the absence of their main creator, Ruben Neves. But, I couldn't have been more mistaken. United did manage a 1-0 win in the end and that is what matters.

United did maintain a slightly higher possession rate at 54%, yet struggled to create chances with it, registering a 1.45 expected goals (xG) compared to Wolves' 2.15. Wolves outperformed United in the tackle department, winning 23 tackles compared to United's 18. Interestingly, while Wolves tackled more, they also committed 5 fewer fouls than United. While this might not hold substantial significance, it could suggest late challenges, indicating a potential lack of match sharpness.

<h2>The set up</h2>

When Onana has the ball, the image shows Martinez and Aaron Wan-Bissaka aka AWB (although not visible) maintaining a wide position, while Varane advances towards the top of the defensive third to engage the Wolves' striker. Shaw inverts into the midfield. If we follow the sequence, the ball is played to Martinez and Shaw rapidly shifts out wide to receive the pass from Martinez. I find myself uncertain about the rationale behind this tactical approach. During this situation, Garnacho didn't drop back to occupy the space left open by Shaw. Shaw's inverted positioning also failed to create room for either Bruno or Mount to drop back into the defensive third. Personally, I would lean towards a different strategy, with Shaw maintaining a wide position while either Mount or Bruno dropping deeper into the midfield area. This configuration might offer more versatility and exploit available spaces more effectively.

Switching to our out-of-possession shape, our pressing approach involves positioning our three forward players between Wolves' central midfielders and defenders. This shape forces the ball wide. Once the ball moves wide, the entire team shifts to the side of the ball to apply pressure and disrupt the opposition's progression, often leading to the ball being played back to the goalkeeper or a turnover in possession. This tactical maneuver effectively creates numerical overloads and defensive pressure, a fundamental element of our defensive strategy. It could also backfire if the opposition team moves the ball quickly to pass around the press.

<h2>First warning from Wolves</h2>

This particular sequence of play commenced with a long ball initiated by the goalkeeper. Unfortunately, we didn't succeed in winning or even contesting for the second ball. The possession shifted back to Dawson (CB), who subsequently distributed the ball out wide, leading to the scenario shown in the image.

In the provided image, it's evident that our two number 8 players are in the process of retreating. Ideally, their positioning should have been within the highlighted section. However, the unfolding sequence of play made achieving this positioning challenging. It's worth noting that images sometimes fail to convey the speed at which Bruno and Mount were recovering.

Fortunately, Casemiro's experience allowed him to discern that the primary threat was a cutback, prompting him to intervene by extending a leg to obstruct the pass. This action provided Bruno with sufficient time to backtrack. This incident highlights an impending concern. Given Bruno and Mount's preference for advanced positions, they will often need to sprint back to cover defensively, potentially posing a recurrent challenge for us.

<h2>United's first chance!</h2>

Around the 10-minute mark, Onana delivers a pass to Mount, which unfortunately he doesn't manage to control. However, the ball falls to Casemiro who plays an impressive line-breaking pass to Antony. At this point, Antony has a decision to make: he should pass the ball to Bruno, enabling Rashford to continue his central run and drag the center-back. Meanwhile, Antony should run down the flank. This pass would have provided Bruno with three viable passing options: Garnacho on the opposite wing, Rashford in the central area, or Antony on the right flank. Additionally, there's a fourth possibility where no defender advances to engage Bruno, affording him the opportunity to take a shot at goal. The current scenario is a 4 vs. 3 situation, providing promising offensive prospects.

The image shows the actual unfolding of the situation. In this instance, Antony persists with his inward run, prompting Rashford to alter his own trajectory. Even at this point, Antony has a chance to pass the ball to Garnacho, yet he opts to slide it to Rashford. An important observation here is that Rashford is actively looking at Garnacho and doesn't anticipate receiving the pass. Rashford's clever movement creates space for Antony. This pass turned a potential 4 vs. 3 advantage into a 2 vs. 2 scenario.

It's evident that Antony's decision-making capabilities need refinement, as this situation underscores.

<h2>Issue with the shape</h2>

The image underscores my previous concerns from the "All I see are gaps" post. Our midfielders are advanced in the opposition's third, creating a numerical advantage of 5 vs. 2. However, they're not close enough to Wolves' players. Casemiro notices the threat but reacts slowly. AWB approaches a Wolves' player before retreating, whereas an immediate retreat would have been wiser. Bruno should have dropped back upon seeing Casemiro and Mount on the opposite side, leaving the midfield exposed. I understand we want to press to win the ball high up the field to cause a turnover, but we can't do that by sacrificing our rest defense. 

![mount loses the ball](/red-army-recaps/assets/match_week_1/mount_losing_ball.jpg)

Casemiro attempts a tactical foul with a sliding challenge, but Cunha evades and moves forward, creating a 3 vs. 3 situation for Wolves. Martinez should retreat, guide the ball wide, and then track Cunha's run. However, he tries to tackle and Cunha gets past, resulting in a 3 vs. 2 advantage for Wolves. Luckily, they don't score.

<h2>Another example of the issue with Bruno and Mount</h2>

What do you expect from your number 8? I would expect Bruno to be aware enough to mark Cunha at this point since Casemiro and Mount are both on the opposite side. There is a passing lane open to Cunha at this point.

![midfield issues](/red-army-recaps/assets/match_week_1/midfield_issues_1.jpg)

In the image below, the blue lines indicate ball movements, while the black lines represent player runs. Let's analyze the game from Mount's viewpoint: "Pedro Neto has turned inside. He has two options: a pass to the CB or one into midfield for Cunha. As a number 8, I should step back and protect the middle." However, Mount is focused on the ball and does nothing.

Shifting our perspective to Bruno: "Cunha has a lot of space, and Mount is not in position while Casemiro is engaged. If Cunha gets the ball, he can advance against my CB. I need to prompt Varane to step or sprint myself." Bruno merely jogs towards Cunha. While I might sound critical, I expect this level of decision-making from my number 8s.

![midfield issues](/red-army-recaps/assets/match_week_1/midfield_issues.jpg)

<h2>A perfect example of how open the game was!</h2>

Antony is in possession of the ball, advancing down the flank. At this juncture, Antony's options are limited. AWB is marked, and there's no available passing lane to Mount. Casemiro is not within view to receive the ball back. Furthermore, Bruno, Rashford, and Garnacho are positioned closely together.

Ideally, Bruno should be positioned in the highlighted area marked by a diamond shape. Rashford's position should be immediately next to the center-back's shoulder, and Garnacho should be situated as is. This arrangement would optimize the team's positioning for a more effective play.

![open game 1](/red-army-recaps/assets/match_week_1/open_game_1.jpg)


AWB and Mount both make identical runs, with Antony attempting to find AWB. This instance highlights suboptimal decision-making. The team's shape doesn't offer Antony a simple passing option either. If Antony had looked up, he would have noticed a 3 vs. 1 situation at the far post. Additionally, there was ample space for him to cut inside and deliver a cross to the far post.

![open game 2](/red-army-recaps/assets/match_week_1/open_game_2.jpg)

The pass is intercepted, and Matheus Nunes gains possession. In this scenario, Casemiro, along with Mount and Bruno stepping in, are well-positioned to tighten the space. The pass to Cunha isn't a feasible option, despite the image suggesting otherwise. Nevertheless, Nunes evades both Casemiro and Bruno's challenges. Given Bruno and Mount's defensive approach, it appears that Casemiro needs to adopt a more conservative positioning moving forward.

![open game 3](/red-army-recaps/assets/match_week_1/open_game_3.jpg)

At this stage, Nunes is unmarked and advancing towards the defensive line. Mount is retreating in a linear path. Adequate cover is present on that side. Ideally, Mount should have moved towards Lindelof to provide additional support.

![open game 4](/red-army-recaps/assets/match_week_1/open_game_4.jpg)

Lindelof had to step up and Shaw had to tuck in as the only side Nunes could go is to his right as the left side was crowded. But that means, Sarabia is free. This is an excellent chance for Wolves.  Notably, comparing Antony's position in the prior and following images, had Mount chosen to run towards Lindelof, Antony could have preserved energy. Suboptimal decisions required teammates to provide additional coverage, affecting the overall dynamic.

<h2>The goal</h2>

This highlights the challenge of assessing Bruno's performance. Even on an off day, he's capable of conjuring brilliance. Preceding this image was a corner, explaining Varane's presence in the final third. Antony aptly chooses to pass back to Bruno, who has room for a cross into the box since Casemiro and Varane are in the final third. However, AWB makes an exceptional untracked run, notably by Lemina.

![goal1](/red-army-recaps/assets/match_week_1/goal_1.jpg)

AWB clips the ball perfectly was the on rushing Varane to cushion it into the goal.

<h2> Final Thoughts </h2>

The midfield situation remains uncertain, particularly the use of two number 10s in the 8 roles. If Mount's transformation into a box-to-box midfielder is intended, a gradual approach is needed. Allowing him 10-15 minutes in games with a 2-goal lead could be effective. Defensively, there's room for improvement in terms of player distances and tracking runners.

In the last game, Garnacho, Antony, Rashford, Mount, and Bruno struggled. Although I'd like to mention Martinez and Casemiro, Martinez's injury recovery and Casemiro's extensive ground coverage need consideration.

For the next match, I expected ETH might reintroduce Eriksen to the midfield. While Pellistri's starting seems unlikely, I'm hopeful. A run of games for Sancho in the False 9 role could be intriguing, acknowledging that he might not function as an out-and-out 9. The idea is to optimize Rashford, our best player, in his preferred position.
