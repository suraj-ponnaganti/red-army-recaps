Just before Garnacho's offside goal, I fired off a message to my friend, brimming with frustration: "This feels like a 3-1 loss for United." Then, Garnacho netted one, and I found myself under fire from my friend, accused of being the pessimistic fan. Surprisingly, I welcomed it, but alas, it was ruled offside. Eric Ten Hag, for the time being, shouldn't shoulder the blame; it's the players who aren't delivering on his expectations. To cap it off, we concluded the game with Harry Maguire and Jonny Evans! It's utterly exasperating... My heart goes out to ETH.

<h2>The game stats</h2>

In the game's culmination, United recorded an Expected Goal (xG) of 0.96, while Arsenal surged ahead with a substantial 2.27. The statistics unequivocally portray United as a lackluster attacking force. Furthermore, Arsenal asserted dominance with 55% of possession and an impressive 12 corners, in stark contrast to United's mere 3. It's become increasingly challenging to recollect when United last capitalized on a corner opportunity, raising questions about their set-piece threat. To emphasize the point, United managed only 3 crosses, whereas Arsenal delivered a staggering 26.

For visual clarity, the image below illustrates the players' average positioning, sourced from [SofaScore](https://www.sofascore.com/arsenal-manchester-united/KR#11352534). Several noteworthy observations can be made:

1. Arsenal's positioning forms a larger, higher, and wider playing area.
2. Arsenal adeptly employs full-back inversion, while United's defensive line remains flat. Notably, Zinchenko (35) shifts inward, creating a midfield triangle that allows Odegaard to drift.
3. Martinelli maintains a high and wide position, akin to Rashford for United. However, Martinelli benefits from better support from Nketiah, Odegaard, and Saka, whereas Rashford appears isolated in the box.

It appears Eric Ten Hag may have overlooked a tactical opportunity here. Personally, I would have favored positioning the winger on Zinchenko's side in a higher and wider role, aligning with the available space on the field. This strategic adjustment could potentially optimize attacking opportunities and create more threat from that flank.

<h2>United take lead for 150 seconds</h2>

This goal was a stark deviation from the prevailing match dynamics, stemming from a moment of individual brilliance. The sequence begins with Havertz losing possession. Eriksen, who is not typically known for his defensive prowess, displays rare proactive defensive work and successfully wins the ball back.

Eriksen then proceeds to carry the ball into available space, delivering a through ball of impeccable precision.

In this scenario, White had the opportunity to do better by forcing Rashford down the line onto his weaker foot. While Saliba anticipated this move and moved to cover that space, White allowed Rashford to cut inside, resulting in both White and Saliba being caught in a defensive line, rendering it nearly as effective as having only one defender. Rashford's shot, executed with perfection, curled beyond reach into the far post with impressive pace.

<h2>Arsenal's quick response</h2>

United seemed caught off guard, possibly still celebrating, as Arsenal swiftly initiated one-touch play. Eriksen, however, proved to be a defensive liability. Despite Martinez's instructions, Eriksen failed to mark Odegaard, who calmly slotted the ball into the net.

Before Odegaard's chance, the defensive options were limited. While Casemiro could have attempted to block the pass through his legs, it would be somewhat harsh to criticize him for that. The primary defensive lapse was Eriksen's failure to effectively mark Odegaard, with no imminent threat in the box requiring him to drop so deep. Maybe Amrabat would have done better?

<h2>Offside Goal</h2>

Great teamwork, swiftly winning the ball and delivering a precise pass to Hojlund, who deftly flicks it to Casemiro (if I recall correctly). Casemiro then threads it into space for Garnacho's decisive run and finish.

As a United fan, my perspective might be biased, but the contentious offside call, even without clear lines in the frame, underscores the challenges with VAR. I apologize for any bias, as I'd likely question the decision if it favored Arsenal.

<h2>Rice proving his worth!</h2>

This defensive display is nothing short of a catastrophe. How a player can chest the ball down, wait for it to bounce and then take a half volley is beyond my understanding! This is what you get for playing Evans and Maguire. While Evans was obstructed, I can't classify it as a foul. I firmly believe that De Gea would have thwarted this goal.

Onana possesses undeniable potential, but his acquisition appears to be a solution for a future predicament. Signing him this early has inadvertently created a problem. The approximately 40 million pounds spent on him could have been allocated to secure a top-tier center-back, potentially salvaging precious points today.

![Goal](/red-army-recaps/assets/match_week_4/corner_tactics.jpg)  

TaTactically, our approach to defending corners employs zonal marking. We aim to keep one center-back and a couple of other players free to track runners. In this situation, Evans should immediately signal to Maguire about the potential incoming run, given the presence of four players in that area. Maguire's responsibility is to effectively mark that run. The inherent risk lies in the fact that if Evans doesn't follow the player, Gabriel could build momentum and potentially out-jump Maguire. Therefore, Maguire needs to impede that run, and it falls on him to do so, as Evans must focus on marking the back post.

<h2>In possession issues</h2>

Lindelof takes possession of the ball, but he finds himself lacking passing options. In this situation, Bruno should position himself in that crucial pocket of space. Regardless of his current position, Bruno must make a sprint to occupy that area. This strategic move would create the opportunity for Lindelof to play a pass to Antony, who can then swiftly relay it to Bruno for a first-time play if Zinchenko applies pressure. Alternatively, if the pressure doesn't come, Antony can turn and take on the full-back directly.

![p1](/red-army-recaps/assets/match_week_4/lack_of_mov_1.jpg)  

As Lindelof finds himself without viable options, he opts to play the ball back to Martinez. Simultaneously, AWB initiates a run into the opposition's third, pulling Zinchenko with him and consequently creating valuable space for Antony to potentially receive a long pass. By the way, Bruno is in this frame showing where he was positioned. Regrettably, Martinez decides not to make the pass to Antony, missing the opportunity to capitalize on the space created by AWB's run.

![p2](/red-army-recaps/assets/match_week_4/lack_of_mov_2.jpg)

Once again, Martinez finds himself in a situation with limited passing options into the middle, with Eriksen being the primary target. He manages to receive the ball, but Antony's lack of movement becomes evident. Antony neither comes short to receive the ball from Eriksen nor makes a run down the line to receive a potential ball played over the top. Instead, he remains stationary, leading to Martinelli marking him effectively.

![p2](/red-army-recaps/assets/match_week_4/lack_of_mov_3.jpg)

A crucial observation in all these images is the absence of active running by United players. Instead of running into space, they appear to be walking. Ideally, you'd want players "arriving" into space to receive passes effectively. This includes having at least one player making a deep run to receive a ball over the top and another player making a run into the midfield half spaces to provide passing options and exploit the available areas effectively. Eric Ten Hag has his work cut out..... The team's utilization of the midfield half spaces is currently lacking, and building effectively with a 3-1-6 shape requires someone to take the initiative and drop into those crucial areas. This adjustment is essential for optimizing their tactical approach.

<h2>Final thoughts (rant) </h2>

I won't go into detail about the final goal, as it felt like a classic "smash and grab" scenario where United had to take risks by pushing up in hopes of equalizing within the remaining two minutes. What adds salt to the wound is that they managed to score during what feels like "Fergie time," intensifying the disappointment.

It seems that Eric Ten Hag may have placed a significant level of trust in his defense to maintain the same level as the previous season. Last season, our third-place finish was primarily attributed to our solid defensive performances. We conceded a total of 43 goals while only scoring 58, the lowest among the top 6 teams. It's worth noting that the 43 goals conceded were concentrated in a couple of particularly heavy defeats, with 6 and 7 goals conceded in matches against City and Liverpool. This could explain why ETH prioritized Mount over Amrabat and why he signed Onana. 

United's ongoing difficulty in maintaining intensity for the full 90 minutes is glaring under Eric Ten Hag's management. His post-match responses have been less than ideal, possibly indicating the onset of "second-season" syndrome. While I remain a supporter of ETH, I'm disheartened by his public criticism of Sancho, especially when the player appears to be struggling with confidence. It's worth noting that many United managers encounter difficulties in their second seasons. As a fan, it's becoming increasingly evident that the club's issues may be rooted in ownership, with the Glazers' financial constraints limiting investment. This emphasizes the pressing need for a change in ownership to facilitate meaningful change.
