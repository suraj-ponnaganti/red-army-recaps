title: "United's midfield battle"

As a devoted United fan, I hold high expectations for brilliance from the team. I initially started supporting the club due to their ethos of unwavering effort and accountability on the pitch. This philosophy resonated with me, and I've been a loyal fan ever since. It's painful to witness the team's struggles.

This season follows a similar pattern. As we approach match week 3, our starting 11 remains unchanged from the previous season due to injuries affecting Mount and Hojlund. Furthermore, injuries to Shaw and Malacia leave us potentially weaker, with Dalot stepping in as a left back. However, my focus today is on the midfield's imbalance.

<h2>The Best Midfield Trio</h2>

Currently, the strongest midfield trio in the league belongs to Manchester City, comprising Rodri, Kovacic, and Kevin De Bruyne (KDB). While KDB is currently sidelined due to injury, alternatives like Bernardo Silva, Phil Foden, and Alvarez(not as much) can step into this role effectively. It's time to consider pairing Rodri with midfield legends like Lampard, Gerrard, and Busquets. Elite!

It's only been two games so far this season, but it's indicative of things to come. Rodri's heat map shows how disciplined he is at staying central.

Kovacic is also very disciplined and holds central positions but slightly more to the right. Alvarez basically has the free role of a 10 horizontally.

Kovacic is similarly disciplined, occupying central positions with a slight rightward shift. Alvarez, on the other hand, enjoys a more flexible role akin to a horizontal number 10. This is what balance looks like.


<h2>The United Midfield Trio</h2>

Casemiro takes on a similar role to Rodri at United, but his heatmap portrays a more scattered distribution. Notably, both players have seen comparable minutes on the field in the league.

Mount and Bruno are tasked with fulfilling the roles of Kovacic and Alvarez, operating as box-to-box midfielders. However, they currently lack the positional discipline that their counterparts demonstrate, often deviating from their designated areas.  I acknowledge that City deploys a conventional central midfielder in Kovacic, while Alvarez operates as a liberated attacking midfielder. ETH, however, anticipates Mount and Bruno to perform with the disciplined attributes of central midfielders.

Eriksen's introduction into the game saw him predominantly occupying the left side of the midfield. While his playing time in this season has been limited, comparing his heatmap to that of the previous season highlights his inclination to remain situated on the left side.

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

Many had initially dismissed Eriksen due to his defensive vulnerabilities. While not particularly strong in ground duels, Eriksen's strength lies in maintaining his positional discipline. In contrast, Bruno has historically enjoyed a more unrestricted role. With Eriksen anchoring one side and Casemiro assuming a deeper position on the opposite flank, the team dynamic was balanced. 

I remain uncertain about Eric Ten Hag's specific expectations for Mount's role. My conjecture is that both Mount and Bruno are intended to operate as box-to-box creative midfielders. However, this shift necessitates discipline from both players. While Bruno historically enjoyed a more unrestricted role, Mount is adapting to a box-to-box position. With two out of three players altering their playing style, this adjustment appears to be causing confusion for Casemiro, who is covering a significant amount of ground. If ETH wants Mount to play as a defensive 8, then this is a bad signing. 

Nonetheless, I anticipate that Mount will find his stride in due course. It's important not to dismiss him prematurely. However, I do have reservations about Bruno's adaptation. His most effective contributions have typically occurred when he operates as a liberated number 10. Imposing constraints on his role might not elicit his optimal performance. TBD....
