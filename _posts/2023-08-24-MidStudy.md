title: "United's midfield battle"

As a devoted United fan, I hold high expectations for brilliance from the team. I initially started supporting the club due to their ethos of unwavering effort and accountability on the pitch. This philosophy resonated with me, and I've been a loyal fan ever since. It's painful to witness the team's struggles.

This season follows a similar pattern. As we approach match week 3, our starting 11 remains unchanged from the previous season due to injuries affecting Mount and Hojlund. Furthermore, injuries to Shaw and Malacia leave us potentially weaker, with Dalot stepping in as a left back. However, my focus today is on the midfield's imbalance.

<h2>The Best Midfield Trio</h2>

Currently, the strongest midfield trio in the league belongs to Manchester City, comprising Rodri, Kovacic, and Kevin De Bruyne (KDB). While KDB is currently sidelined due to injury, alternatives like Bernardo Silva, Phil Foden, and Alvarez(not as much) can step into this role effectively. It's time to consider pairing Rodri with midfield legends like Lampard, Gerrard, and Busquets. Elite!

It's only been two games so far this season, but it's indicative of things to come.
