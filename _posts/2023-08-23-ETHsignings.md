I watched a YouTube video where a United fan asked a fellow fan and YouTube expert, "ETH has spent nearly 350 million pounds and the team is still the same. Look at other teams who've spent far less. How much do you think ETH needs?" This question makes me very angry and brings up an interesting point about how Manchester United's management puts the manager under pressure. Let's break down United's signings and look at how other teams have spent in the same period.

<h2>United's "Actual" spend since ETH took reigns!</h2>

This is the amount United has paid for ETH's signings so far. Various sources provide slightly different figures, but they align closely with the numbers in the table.

Player            |  Price				| How much did we overpay?
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
Antony  	|  £81.9m (plus £4.3m in add-ons)  | ~£25m
Hojlund     |  £64m (plus £8m in add-ons)	   | ~£20m
Casemiro    |  £60m (plus £10m in add-ons) 	   | ~£25m
Mount       |  £55m (plus £5m in add-ons)      | ~£15m
Martinez    |  £46.8m (plus £8.5m in add-ons)  | ~£15m
Onana 		|  £43.8m (plus £3.4m in add-ons)  | ~£5m  
Malacia 	|  £12.9m (plus £1.7m in add-ons)  | Fair 
Eriksen 	|  free transfer				   |  - 
<b>TOTAL</b>       | <b>~£365m</b> 	| <b>Overspent by about ~£105m </b>

Over 2 transfer windows, Eric Ten Hag has actually spent around ~£265m. The same argument can be made for Chelsea. Chelsea have bought Caicedo for ~£100m, Enzo for ~£100m, Mudryk for ~£60m, Fofana for ~£70m etc. Chelsea have also overpaid, but Chelsea have the money and also sell players like Mount for ~£60m and Havertz for ~£75m.

Arsenal made purchases such as Jesus (~£45m), Rice (~£100m), and Havertz (~£65m), but also secured Odegaard for ~£30m. They've also clearly over paid Rice and Havertz. Odegaard is steal deal! 

City on the other hand have spent ~£80m on Gavrdiol. They've also bought Haaland and Kovacic for ~£55m and ~£25m, respectively. City have such a strong team that they can walk away from a player if the club quotes ridiculous price and still have a stong starting 11 + bench.

<h2>Value for Money</h2>

Let's contrast Chelsea's expenditures with United's spending. Chelsea has employed a 3-4-3 formation this season, deploying Enzo and Gallagher (soon to be replaced by Caicedo) as their midfield duo. United, on the other hand, utilizes a midfield trio. In Chelsea's system, chance creation is primarily shouldered by the front three, given the system, while United relies on Bruno in that role. Enzo functions as Chelsea's deep-lying playmaker, paralleling (well.. not exactly) Mount's role for United.

This is Enzo and Caicedo's FBref report. Credit goes to them!

Enzo            |  Caicedo				
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![s1](/red-army-recaps/assets/spend/enzo.jpg)  | ![s2](/red-army-recaps/assets/spend/caicedo.jpg) 

Enzo is great at passing (95th percentile for passes attempted and 85th percentile for passes completed) and excels as a deep-lying playmaker. His xAG (expected assists) is solid at the 70th percentile, and his lower "Touched in Penalty box" rank (36th percentile) shows he's good at holding his position in midfield. This is important for a 3-4-3 setup. Enzo also shines in defense, ranking 95th percentile in blocks and 80th percentile in tackles.

Caicedo, too, is a good passer (88th percentile for passes attempted and 95th percentile for passes completed). His xAG is a bit lower (45th percentile), indicating safer passes that connect defense and attack. He's strong defensively, ranking 87th percentile in tackles and 89th percentile in interceptions.

When considering this system holistically, Caicedo demonstrates efficient passing with a low xAG, indicating his role in facilitating secure connections between defense and midfield/attack. He also ranks in the 78th percentile for progressive passing. On the other hand, Enzo, has a slightly lower pass completion, but is in the 98th percentile for progressive passes and holds a 72nd percentile ranking for xAG – showcasing his inclination toward more ambitious passes, especially in linking the midfield and defense to the attack. Together, their coverage in tackles, interceptions, and blocks creates a remarkable balance in the team. This is a great way to spend money.

Bruno            |  Mount				| Casemiro
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:

Let's examine Bruno and Mount as the two midfielders. Both Bruno and Mount have defensive action rankings below the 50th percentile. It's important not to overinterpret this data. Bruno is primarily a CAM and has been utilized as such, which reflects in his lower defensive actions. He excels in playmaking, ranking in the 99th percentile for creative attributes. Similarly, Mount has been deployed in attacking roles, including the left wing, affecting his defensive statistics. This doesn't mean they can't do. What it does mean is they haven't played in systems that demand defensive actions from them and now we suddenly want them to do it. While Casemiro is elite in most defensive actions (95th percentile), he can't cover the entire midfield. Our investment of approximately £60 million is directed towards a player who needs to adapt to the role of an 8. However, I do think Mount will come good. I don't think Mount was ETH's first target even though the media makes it out to be like that. 

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

Pep and Klopp have shaped their teams with 11 players they have acquired. They've also had longer managerial stints compared to ETH. Pep also came in when City were already in good shape. Arteta has brought in approximately 9 players for his starting 11, while ETH has introduced around 5 players to his first-choice lineup, alongside a surplus of players not contributing effectively.

The issue of excessive spending isn't solely on ETH. The management's overindulgence in transfers has hindered ETH's ability to acquire his preferred players. The surplus spending could have been directed towards acquiring both De Jong and Amrabat. It's crucial to exercise patience with ETH, as he is a capable manager with a distinct footballing identity. The key lies in providing him with the right players, which is currently lacking in our squad.
