title: "ETH has (not) spent over 360 million pounds"

I watched a YouTube video where a United fan asked a fellow fan and YouTube expert, "ETH has spent nearly 350 million pounds and the team is still the same. Look at other teams who've spent far less. How much do you think ETH needs?" This question makes me very angry and brings up an interesting point about how Manchester United's management puts the manager under pressure. Let's break down United's signings and look at how other teams have spent in the same period.

<h2>United's "Actual" spend since ETH took reigns!</h2>

This is the amount United has paid for ETH's signings so far. Various sources provide slightly different figures, but they align closely with the numbers in the table.

Player            |  Price				| How much did we overpay?
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
Antony  	|  £81.9m (plus £4.3m in add-ons)  | ~£25m
Hojlund     |  £64m (plus £8m in add-ons)	   | ~£20m
Casemiro    |  £60m (plus £10m in add-ons) 	   | ~£25m
Mount       |  £55m (plus £5m in add-ons)      | ~£15m
Martinez    |  £46.8m (plus £8.5m in add-ons)  | ~£15m
Onana 		|  £43.8m (plus £3.4m in add-ons)  | ~£5m  
Malacia 	|  £12.9m (plus £1.7m in add-ons)  | Fair 
Eriksen 	|  free transfer				   |  - 
<b>TOTAL</b>       | <b>~£365m</b> 	| <b>Overspent by about ~£105m </b>

Over 2 transfer windows, Eric Ten Hag has actually spent around ~£265m. The same argument can be made for Chelsea. Chelsea have bought Caicedo for ~£100m, Enzo for ~£100m, Mudryk for ~£60m, Fofana for ~£70m etc. Chelsea have also overpaid, but Chelsea have the money and also sell players like Mount for ~£60m and Havertz for ~£75m.

<h2>Value for Money</h2>

Let's contrast Chelsea's expenditures with United's spending. Chelsea has employed a 3-4-3 formation this season, deploying Enzo and Gallagher (soon to be replaced by Caicedo) as their midfield duo. United, on the other hand, utilizes a midfield trio. In Chelsea's system, chance creation is primarily shouldered by the front three, given the system, while United relies on Bruno in that role. Enzo functions as Chelsea's deep-lying playmaker, paralleling (well.. not exactly) Mount's role for United.

This is Enzo and Caicedo's FBref report. Credit goes to them!

Enzo            |  Caicedo				
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:

Enzo is great at passing (95th percentile for passes attempted and 85th percentile for passes completed) and excels as a deep-lying playmaker. His xAG (expected assists) is solid at the 70th percentile, and his lower "Touched in Penalty box" rank (36th percentile) shows he's good at holding his position in midfield. This is important for a 3-4-3 setup. Enzo also shines in defense, ranking 95th percentile in blocks and 80th percentile in tackles.

Caicedo, too, is a good passer (88th percentile for passes attempted and 95th percentile for passes completed). His xAG is a bit lower (45th percentile), indicating safer passes that connect defense and attack. He's strong defensively, ranking 87th percentile in tackles and 89th percentile in interceptions.

When considering this system holistically, Caicedo demonstrates efficient passing with a low xAG, indicating his role in facilitating secure connections between defense and midfield/attack. He also ranks in the 78th percentile for progressive passing. On the other hand, Enzo, has a slightly lower pass completion, but is in the 98th percentile for progressive passes and holds a 72nd percentile ranking for xAG – showcasing his inclination toward more ambitious passes, especially in linking the midfield and defense to the attack. Together, their coverage in tackles, interceptions, and blocks creates a remarkable balance in the team. This is a great way to spend money.
