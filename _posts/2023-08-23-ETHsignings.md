I watched a YouTube video where a United fan asked a fellow fan and YouTube expert, "ETH has spent nearly 350 million pounds and the team is still the same. Look at other teams who've spent far less. How much do you think ETH needs?" This question makes me very angry and brings up an interesting point about how Manchester United's management puts the manager under pressure. Let's break down United's signings and look at how other teams have spent in the same period.
