I watched a YouTube video where a United fan asked a fellow fan and YouTube expert, "ETH has spent nearly 350 million pounds and the team is still the same. Look at other teams who've spent far less. How much do you think ETH needs?" This question makes me very angry and brings up an interesting point about how Manchester United's management puts the manager under pressure. Let's break down United's signings and look at how other teams have spent in the same period.

<h2>United's "Actual" spend since ETH took reigns!</h2>

This is the amount United has paid for ETH's signings so far. Various sources provide slightly different figures, but they align closely with the numbers in the table.

Player            |  Price				| How much did we overpay?
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
Antony  	|  £81.9m (plus £4.3m in add-ons)  | ~£25m
Hojlund     |  £64m (plus £8m in add-ons)	   | ~£20m
Casemiro    |  £60m (plus £10m in add-ons) 	   | ~£25m
Mount       |  £55m (plus £5m in add-ons)      | ~£15m
Martinez    |  £46.8m (plus £8.5m in add-ons)  | ~£15m
Onana 		|  £43.8m (plus £3.4m in add-ons)  | ~£5m  
Malacia 	|  £12.9m (plus £1.7m in add-ons)  | Fair 
Eriksen 	|  free transfer				   |  - 
<b>TOTAL</b>       | <b>~£365m</b> 	| <b>Overspent by about ~£105m </b>

Over 2 transfer windows, Eric Ten Hag has actually spent around ~£265m. The same argument can be made for Chelsea. Chelsea have bought Caicedo for ~£100m, Enzo for ~£100m, Mudryk for ~£60m, Fofana for ~£70m etc. Chelsea have also overpaid, but Chelsea have the money and also sell players like Mount for ~£60m and Havertz for ~£75m.

<h2>Value for Money</h2>

Let's contrast Chelsea's expenditures with United's spending. Chelsea has employed a 3-4-3 formation this season, deploying Enzo and Gallagher (soon to be replaced by Caicedo) as their midfield duo. United, on the other hand, utilizes a midfield trio. In Chelsea's system, chance creation is primarily shouldered by the front three, given the system, while United relies on Bruno in that role. Enzo functions as Chelsea's deep-lying playmaker, paralleling (well.. not exactly) Mount's role for United.

This is Enzo and Caicedo.

Enzo            |  Caicedo
