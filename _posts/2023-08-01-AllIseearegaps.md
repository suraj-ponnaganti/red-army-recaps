For years, I've remained a devoted supporter of Manchester United, enduring disappointment season after season. However, the tides seemed to turn during the 2022/23 season, offering reasons for celebration and renewed optimism. With bated breath, I awaited the arrival of June 10, 2023—the commencement of the European summer transfer window. As we approach the closing stages of the window, a sense of concern begins to set in as I observe persistent gaps that remain unfilled.

The image below is what I suspect our starting 11 is going to look like. As of writing this article, Amrabat is not yet a united player. There is case to be made for Eriksen starting over Mount. The 2022 season taught us that ETH tends to favor players he has brought in. Hence, I suspect mount starts.

The best way to analyze this team is to think about the key areas of problems we had last year and if we've filled them. 

<h2>Lack of a striker</h2>
Soccer has undergone significant evolution over the past 10-15 years, with a heightened emphasis on technical intricacies. This evolution has notably impacted player roles, particularly among strikers who now encompass diverse styles. For example, Erling Haaland excels within the penalty box due to his exceptional spatial awareness and movement, allowing him to create valuable openings in tight spaces. Victor Osimhen, who shares some traits with Haaland, has also been linked to the club, albeit acknowledging the differences between the two.

On the flip side, we have strikers like Firmino from Liverpool, who prefer to drop deeper into midfield. This strategic move aims to create opportunities for wingers by exploiting the gaps left by defenders tracking the withdrawn striker. Another example of this is Harry Kane, who effectively plays a playmaking role by dropping into the number 10 position.

So who is the right fit for united? An out-and-out penalty box striker or a False 9 like striker?

Considering Manchester United's playing dynamics, a false 9 like Harry Kane seems to align more harmoniously. The reasoning behind this choice revolves around Rashford and Antony's proclivity to cut inside rather than delivering wide crosses. Moreover, the team's fullbacks often adopt an inverted positioning, further limiting the efficacy of an outright penalty box striker.

The recent addition of Hojlund has sparked curiosity, though with certain reservations. While my exposure to his performances is limited, highlights indicate his preference for occupying wider areas and then moving the ball inward. This style raises concerns due to Rashford's typical positioning. However, Hojlund's ability to drop into midfield and initiate forward movement is promising and could be honed under ETH's coaching. Enhancing his link-up play is essential; his current pass completion rate stands at around 73%, ranking in the 42nd percentile for assists and 53rd percentile for expected assists. However, when combining his expected non-penalty goals and expected assists, he ranks in the 70th percentile.

In conclusion, while the deficiency in the squad has been partly addressed, Hojlund's true impact will only unfold during actual matches. The need for a second striker remains paramount. If Hojlund can manage frequent appearances, it might afford Martial more time for training and fitness recovery. Nevertheless, acquiring a dedicated second striker remains a priority.

<h2>A number 8 aka box-to-box midfielder!</h2>
In recent years, Manchester United has been acquiring players who specialize in one position and then attempting to transform them into something different. Eriksen serves as another instance of this trend - however, it worked this time! His remarkable understanding of soccer, coupled with his high intelligence on the field, made him excel during the initial part of the season. Unfortunately, his performance fell after an ankle injury caused by Andy Carroll.

Eriksen possesses a unique skill in connecting the play from deeper areas to the final third. An illustrative moment of this ability was his line-breaking pass against Arsenal, which resulted in Antony's first goal for Manchester United.

However, his individual defending skills, especially in one-on-one situations, have raised concerns. He often gets bypassed easily and appeared fatigued during the latter part of the season. Fred and McTominay, who filled in for him, present a significant decline in quality. McTominay tends to stick closely to his assigned marker, even if the opposing player creates space. McTominay can sometimes get caught behind an opponent, preventing him from freeing up. All this to say, we need a box-to-box. Eriksen played as a 'free' 8 for most parts, but we saw what happens when we don't have a defensive 8 against big teams. Therefore, we require a midfielder who possesses the ability to defend effectively while also contributing to the team's link-up play.

Who did we sign - Mason Mount?

Mason Mount is a great player, but another example of buying a number 10 (is he a 10?) to play as an 8. The approach that ETH appears to be pursuing involves deploying two players in the central midfield positions as number 8s (or repurposed number 10s in the number 8 roles) – Bruno and Mount – with Casemiro positioned behind them. "Games are won in the midfield" is a phrase often used, and rightfully so. However, I'm not particularly fond of the idea of employing two players who are traditionally number 10s as number 8s. In general, Bruno operates as a high-risk, high-reward type of number 10, which occasionally results in him losing possession. That's the nature of his playing style. Consequently, what we need is a player with a somewhat more defensive inclination, and Mount doesn't quite fit that mold. He possesses the energy to cover the ground but lacks the discipline required to hold a deeper position. Additionally, considering that he will be playing alongside AWB, Varane, and Antony, it's important to note that AWB and Varane aren't particularly proficient at swiftly progressing the ball, while Antony occasionally makes decisions that lead to turnovers. One might suggest that Mount plays as a 10 and Bruno as an 8, but that might not be ideal. While Bruno's quarterback-like role is commendable, it might not match ETH's style. It's likelier they'll both function as 8s. Eriksen might not be as mobile as Mount, but he is a far more intelligent player and sets the tempo of the midfield. I do not think Mount is an upgrade yet. But he can be coached! 

Have we resolved the midfield concern? From my perspective, not yet. A defensive-minded box-to-box player who can also cover as a CDM to support Casemiro is necessary. Amrabat appears to be a strong choice considering our financial constraints. I still find it perplexing why Mount was prioritized as a signing. Opting for Amrabat over Mount would have been a more logical decision in my view.

<h2>A ball playing keeper!</h2>
David De Gea has been a commendable contributor to Manchester United. His prowess as a shot stopper is undeniably remarkable, making him one of the best in that aspect. However, his ability to distribute the ball from the back leaves much to be desired. While I don't perceive this as a critical area to address, I would have placed higher priority on bolstering other positions this summer. Nevertheless, our acquisition of Onana serves as an excellent replacement choice.

De Gea's occasional errors translated into dropped points for the team. Onana, with his daring playing style, might introduce a different set of challenges and potential points lost. Yet, the anticipation is that his compensatory skills, such as precise passes into the midfield and over the top, akin to his performances with Inter, can counterbalance these potential setbacks. This approach mirrors the impactful strategies employed by Alisson and Ederson for Liverpool and Manchester City, respectively.

I do think Onana is a great signing! But not a necessary one.

<h2>How do we look after these signings?</h2>
The right side of Manchester United's lineup is a significant concern for me. Varane shines in defense and stands as one of our best center-backs. Likewise, AWB exhibits impressive defensive skills. However, both players encounter challenges on the ball. Varane, while possessing a strong ability for switching the play, falls short in delivering line-breaking passes into the half space, a zone likely to be occupied by Mount.

AWB's prowess in short passing tends to be overlooked, although it often involves lateral movements or delivering the ball to Antony when he's retreating towards United's goal. In my observation, AWB rarely attempts to clip a pass over the top to Antony. I'd argue that Antony's dribbling ability isn't as exceptional as some might think. While he occasionally displays acceleration that lets him bypass a defender, he lacks the speed required to create significant separation. Additionally, his decision-making tends to lead to turnovers rather than successful plays, a factor that compounds the issue.

In the English Premier League (EPL), swift ball movement is crucial to prevent opposition teams from doubling up on the wingers. Antony at Ajax benefited from fullbacks underlapping to draw one of the defenders, thereby opening up space for him to cut inside and take shots. However, AWB and Dalot don't employ this tactic effectively. Dalot, although often praised for his ball skills, can sometimes overhit his crosses. Yet, his remarkable cross to Bruno against Southampton stands out. While he provides a superior ball-playing option, his defensive capabilities are debatable. On the other hand, both AWB and Dalot occasionally lose focus, leaving the back post vulnerable. It's possible to make the case that Mount's strengths might come to the fore when he underlaps, but then the question arises: wasn't he initially positioned as an 8? What is he doing there? And if he does end up in that underlapping role, will Bruno exhibit the discipline to temporarily assume a deeper position on the opposite side, enabling Casemiro to move towards Mount and compact the play in case of a turnover? I hold reservations about this scenario. Bruno tends to adopt aggressive positions, and any instance of possession loss could potentially leave us exposed to counterattacks.

A traditional 8 is good at defense. What does this mean? Broadly speaking - there are 3 things. Tracking your runner, checking your shoulder and communicating with you CDM and other players to watch for runners that they can't cover. It's not that Mount won't do this, but something that needs to be coached. 

Rashford's performance can be astonishing when he's at his best. However, on off-days, he tends to lower his head and charge directly into defenders. Furthermore, he isn't particularly known for delivering crosses from the wide positions. Could this be due to the absence of a consistent striker in our lineup, or is it a part of his inherent style? One can speculate whether this might shift with the presence of Hojlund. Notably, Rashford and Martial demonstrated promising chemistry when Martial was fit, and I remain hopeful that a similar synergy can be established with Hojlund.

This brings to light an area where Hojlund might need refinement. Martial excels in linking up play, something that could greatly benefit our attacking dynamics.

<h2>Shape in possession</h2>
This is what I suspect we will look like in possession.

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
This transfer window has proven to be quite underwhelming. We've brought in an injured striker, made a significant goalkeeper acquisition – a move that I'd argue wasn't urgently needed – and secured a number 10 to play as an 8, while Amrabat, who could have been a more fitting option, remains on the sidelines. The midfield seems to be a potential weak point. Mount will need to adjust, and ETH will likely need to adapt his strategies accordingly. It's worth noting that these might not have been ETH's first choices. The absence of a proper number 8 might pose challenges for us this season. Additionally, the thought of selling Maguire and acquiring a right-sided center-back with strong ball-playing abilities is necessary. Rating this window, I'd give it a 5/10, especially when considering what Chelsea has managed to accomplish.
