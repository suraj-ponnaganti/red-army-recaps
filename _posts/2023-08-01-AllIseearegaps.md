title: "Gaps in the starting 11"

For years, I've remained a devoted supporter of Manchester United, enduring disappointment season after season. However, the tides seemed to turn during the 2022/23 season, offering reasons for celebration and renewed optimism. With bated breath, I awaited the arrival of June 10, 2023—the commencement of the European summer transfer window. As we approach the closing stages of the window, a sense of concern begins to set in as I observe persistent gaps that remain unfilled.

The image below is what I suspect our starting 11 is going to look like. As of writing this article, Amrabat is not yet a united player. There is case to be made for Eriksen starting over Mount. The 2022 season taught us that ETH tends to favor players he has brought in. Hence, I suspect Mount starts.

The best way to analyze this team is to think about the key areas of problems we had last year and if we've filled them. 

<h2>Lack of a striker</h2>
There are different kinds of strikers. For example, Erling Haaland excels within the penalty box due to his exceptional spatial awareness and movement, allowing him to create valuable openings in tight spaces. Victor Osimhen, who shares some traits with Haaland, has also been linked to the club. Keywords - "Some traits".

On the flip side, we have strikers like Firmino from Liverpool, who prefer to drop deeper into midfield. This move aims to create opportunities for wingers by exploiting the gaps left by defenders tracking the withdrawn striker. Another example of this is Harry Kane, who effectively plays a playmaking role by dropping into the number 10 position.

Who is the right fit for united? An out-and-out penalty box striker or a False 9 like striker?

Considering Manchester United's playing dynamics, a false 9 like Harry Kane seems to align more. The reasoning behind this choice revolves around Rashford and Antony's proclivity to cut inside rather than delivering wide crosses. Moreover, the team's fullbacks often adopt an inverted positioning, further limiting the efficacy of an outright penalty box striker. In simple terms - there will be fewer crosses attempted from the wide. 

The recent addition of Hojlund has sparked curiosity, though with certain reservations. While my exposure to his performances is limited, highlights indicate his preference for occupying wider areas and then carrying the ball inward. However, Hojlund's ability to drop into midfield and link-up play is promising and could be honed under ETH's coaching. Enhancing his link-up play is essential; his current pass completion rate stands at around 73%, ranking in the 42nd percentile for passes and 53rd percentile for expected assists. However, when combining his expected non-penalty goals and expected assists, he ranks in the 70th percentile.

For this section, I sourced my heat maps from [here](https://www.sofascore.com/player/rasmus-hojlund/1086417)

There have been comparisions between the two and I hope this puts it to bed. Erling Haaland is a penalty box striker (best in the world at that).

Now, if you look at Hojlund's heatmap, it's evident that he like to drop in the midfield specially on the left side. Antony likes to stay wide. As a system of Rashford, Hojlund and Antony, we will cover the spaces well. 

In conclusion, while the deficiency in the squad has been partly addressed, Hojlund's true impact will only unfold during actual matches. The need for a second striker remains paramount. If Hojlund can manage to stay fit, it might afford Martial more time for training and fitness recovery. Nevertheless, acquiring a dedicated second striker remains a priority. I am excited! But let's not forget - he is developmental. The price tag is not his fault! 

<h2>A number 8 aka box-to-box midfielder!</h2>
In recent years, Manchester United has been acquiring players who specialize in one position and then attempting to transform them into something different. Eriksen serves as another instance of this trend - however, it worked this time! His remarkable understanding of soccer, coupled with his high intelligence on the field, made him excel during the initial part of the season. Unfortunately, his performance fell after an ankle injury caused by Andy Carroll.

Eriksen possesses a unique skill in connecting the play from deeper areas to the final third. An illustrative moment of this ability was his line-breaking pass against Arsenal, which resulted in Antony's first goal for Manchester United.

However, his defending skills, especially in one-on-one situations, have raised concerns. He often gets bypassed easily and appeared fatigued during the latter part of the season. Fred and McTominay, who filled in for him, present a significant decline in quality. McTominay tends to stick closely to his assigned marker, even if the opposing player creates space. All this to say, we need a box-to-box. Eriksen played as a 'free' 8 for most parts, but we saw what happens when we don't have a defensive 8 against big teams. Therefore, we require a midfielder who possesses the ability to defend effectively while also connecting defense and attack.

Who did we sign - Mason Mount?

Mason Mount is a great player, but another example of buying a number 10 (is he a 10?) to play as an 8. The approach that ETH appears to be pursuing involves deploying two players in the central midfield(CM) positions as number 8s (or repurposed number 10s in the number 8 roles) – Bruno and Mount – with Casemiro positioned behind them. "Games are won in the midfield" is a phrase often used, and rightfully so. However, I'm not particularly fond of the idea of employing two players who are traditionally number 10s as number 8s. In general, Bruno operates as a high-risk, high-reward type of number 10, which often results in him losing possession. Consequently, what we need is a player with more defensive inclination, and Mount doesn't fit that mold. He possesses the energy to cover the ground but lacks the discipline required to hold a deeper position. Additionally, considering that he will be playing alongside Aaron Wan-Bassaka (AWB), Varane, and Antony, it's important to note that AWB and Varane aren't particularly proficient at swiftly progressing the ball, while Antony occasionally makes decisions that lead to turnovers. Another possibility is that Mount plays as a 10 and Bruno as an 8, but that might not be ideal. While Bruno's quarterback-like role is commendable, it might not match ETH's style. It's likelier they'll both function as 8s. Eriksen might not be as mobile as Mount, but he is a far more intelligent player and sets the tempo of the midfield. I do not think Mount is an upgrade yet. But he can be coached! 

Have we resolved the midfield concern? From my perspective, not yet. A defensive-minded box-to-box player who can also cover as a CDM to give Casemiro a break is necessary. Amrabat appears to be a strong choice considering our financial constraints. I still find it perplexing why Mount was prioritized as a signing. Opting for Amrabat over Mount would have been a more logical decision in my view. Also, Hojlund likes to drop into the space that Mount would like to take (or Bruno). We need a number 8 who is happy to sit back during in the initial build up phase or Hojlund will need to be more disciplined. 

<h2>A ball playing keeper!</h2>
David De Gea has been a commendable contributor to Manchester United. His prowess as a shot stopper is undeniably remarkable, making him one of the best in that aspect. However, his ability to distribute the ball from the back leaves much to be desired. While I don't perceive this as a critical area to address, I would have placed higher priority on bolstering other positions this summer. Nevertheless, our acquisition of Onana serves as an excellent replacement choice.

De Gea's occasional errors translated into dropped points for the team. Onana, with his daring playing style, might introduce a different set of challenges and potential points lost. Yet, the anticipation is that his compensatory skills, such as precise passes into the midfield and over the top, akin to his performances with Inter, can counterbalance these potential setbacks. This approach mirrors the impactful strategies employed by Alisson and Ederson for Liverpool and Manchester City, respectively.

I do think Onana is a great signing! But not a necessary one.

<h2>How do we look after these signings?</h2>
The right side of Manchester United's lineup is a significant concern for me. Varane shines in defense and is our best center-back. Likewise, AWB has impressive defensive skills. However, both players are subpar on the ball. Varane, while possessing a strong ability for switching the play, falls short in delivering line-breaking passes into the half space, a zone likely to be occupied by Mount.

AWB's prowess in short passing tends to be overlooked, although it often involves lateral movements or delivering the ball to Antony when he's retreating towards United's goal. In my observation, AWB rarely attempts to clip a pass over the top to Antony. I'd argue that Antony's dribbling ability isn't as exceptional as some might think. While he occasionally displays acceleration that lets him bypass a defender, he lacks the speed required to create significant separation. Additionally, his decision-making tends to lead to turnovers rather than successful plays, a factor that compounds the issue. And all these players are on the right side! 

![starting 11 gaps](/red-army-recaps/assets/gaps.jpg)

In the English Premier League (EPL), swift ball movement is crucial to prevent opposition teams from doubling up on the wingers. Antony at Ajax benefited from fullbacks underlapping to draw one of the defenders, thereby opening up space for him to cut inside and take shots. Both, AWB and Dalot don't do this effectively. While Dalot provides a superior ball-playing option, his defensive abilities are debatable. Both AWB and Dalot occasionally lose focus, leaving the back post vulnerable. It's possible to make the case that Mount's strengths might come to the fore when he underlaps, but then the question arises: wasn't he initially positioned as an 8? What is he doing there? And if he does end up in that underlapping role, will Bruno exhibit the discipline to temporarily assume a deeper position on the opposite side, enabling Casemiro to move towards Mount and compact the play in case of a turnover? I hold reservations about this scenario. Bruno is an aggressive player, and any instance of possession loss could leave us exposed to counterattacks.

A traditional 8 is good at defense. What does this mean? Some important traits are - tracking the runner, checking his shoulder and communicating with you CDM and other players to watch for runners that they can't cover. It's not that Mount won't do this, but something that needs to be coached. 

Rashford's performance can be astonishing when he's at his best. However, on off-days, he tends to lower his head and charge directly into defenders only to lose the ball. Furthermore, he isn't particularly known for delivering crosses from the wide positions. Could this be due to the absence of a consistent striker in our lineup, or is it a part of his inherent style? One can speculate whether this might shift with the presence of Hojlund. Notably, Rashford and Martial demonstrated promising chemistry when Martial was fit, and I remain hopeful that a similar synergy can be established with Hojlund.

<h2>Shape in possession</h2>
For the sake of illustration, let's focus on Antony who, in my opinion, is the weak link in our attack. When Antony has the ball, I envision AWB making an underlapping run to draw attention from the CM or the left winger (LW) who is likely to double up on Antony. This movement should prompt Mount to shift outward slightly, allowing Casemiro to maintain his central position. A solid diamond of Varane-Martinez-Shaw-Casemiro as rest defense. This setup offers Antony three viable options. If the LW or CM fails to track AWB, Antony can play a pass to AWB, or cut inside to thread a pass or shoot, or pass the ball to Mount and then move into a more central position while AWB goes wide again. In the event of possession loss, Antony would backtrack, Mount would already be positioned deeper, and Casemiro would be central. AWB, on the other hand, would rapidly transition back to a defensive position.

In the second scenario, I envision Mount executing an underlapping run, causing Casemiro to move slightly inwards while AWB maintains his position. This configuration affords Antony the same three options as before. However, a concern arises here: Mount is no longer positioned alongside Casemiro or in a deeper role. Casemiro's inward shift also leaves the central position exposed. Yet, there's a potential solution by having Bruno step back a bit, creating a box defensive shape with Varane-Martinez-Casemiro-Bruno. This modification alters our 2022 season's rest defensive structure. The advantage of this setup lies in Mount's effectiveness in this box compared to AWB. However, this approach relies heavily on Bruno's awareness to drop back, which I'm skeptical about. In all likelihood, we might find both 8s in advanced positions, leaving Casemiro with a significant ground to cover defensively.

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
This transfer window has proven to be quite underwhelming. We've brought in an injured striker, made a significant goalkeeper acquisition – a move that I'd argue wasn't urgently needed – and secured a number 10 to play as an 8, while Amrabat, who could have been a more fitting option, remains on the sidelines. The midfield seems to be a potential weak point. Mount will need to adjust, and ETH will likely need to adapt his strategies accordingly. It's worth noting that these might not have been ETH's first choices. The absence of a proper number 8 might pose challenges for us this season. Additionally, the thought of selling Maguire and acquiring a right-sided center-back with strong ball-playing abilities is necessary. Rating this window, I'd give it a 5/10, especially when considering what Chelsea has managed to accomplish.
