For years, I've remained a devoted supporter of Manchester United, enduring disappointment season after season. However, the tides seemed to turn during the 2022/23 season, offering reasons for celebration and renewed optimism. With bated breath, I awaited the arrival of June 10, 2023â€”the commencement of the European summer transfer window. As we approach the closing stages of the window, a sense of concern begins to set in as I observe persistent gaps that remain unfilled.

The image below is what I suspect our starting 11 is going to look like. As of writing this article, Amrabat is not yet a united player. There is case to be made for Eriksen starting over Mount. The 2022 season taught us that ETH tends to favor players he has brought in. Hence, I suspect mount starts.
