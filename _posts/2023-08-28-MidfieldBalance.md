Understanding the intricacies of the midfield position in soccer sheds light on its pivotal role in shaping a team's performance. Having personally transitioned from a left-winger to a box-to-box midfielder during my high school days, I've gained a deep appreciation for the complexity of this position. The unique challenge lies in being aware of every aspect of the game, both in possession and during defensive actions.

Unlike defenders, who see the game unfold in front of them, or forwards and wingers, who focus on attacking or exploiting spaces, midfielders must juggle numerous responsibilities simultaneously. They need to consider the pressing opponent, available space for their first touch, the positioning of attacking teammates, and more during offensive plays. Defensively, tracking and monitoring opponents' movements are crucial. Given that most goals involve central play, the midfield's impact on the game's outcome is undeniable. Formations like 4-3-3, 4-2-3-1, and others primarily dictate the midfield shape, as attackers, wingers, and fullbacks remain fairly consistent components and the patterns of play vary sligthly. Pep Guardiola's innovation of inverted fullbacks, designed to create midfield overloads and isolate wingers against opposition fullbacks, further underscores the midfield's strategic importance. In essence, the midfield shapes a team's chances of success.

In my perspective, the distinction between good midfielders such as Palhinha and Douglas Luiz and elite midfielders like Rodri or Casemiro doesn't solely revolve around technical skills. While both groups are proficient in executing passes, turns, and on-the-ball actions, it's the profound footballing sense – encompassing positioning, spatial awareness, and game context – that sets the elite apart. The heart of soccer comprehension lies in grasping positional play, understanding dynamic surroundings, and optimizing distances.

With this groundwork laid, let's delve into how top-tier teams structure their midfields to optimize their gameplay.


<h2>Manchester City</h2>

The provided heat maps were sourced from sofascore.com after the initial 3 games of the season. Manchester City predominantly deploys a 4-3-3 formation, with one center-back transitioning into the midfield to generate overloads. To balance this adjustment, one of the full-backs inverts to maintain a central position. In the City midfield, Rodri assumes a pivotal CDM role from just outside the box, functioning as a deep-lying playmaker. Kovacic holds a slightly advanced position, yet remains predominantly oriented toward defensive responsibilities as a box-to-box midfielder, renowned for his exceptional ball-carrying abilities. Meanwhile, Alvarez enjoys greater positional freedom, performing in the mold of a number 10 – a role previously occupied by KDB.

Let's delve into the positional interplay among each role in Manchester City's setup. Kyle Walker, a quintessential full-back, aptly fulfills his role by offering width on the right wing. On the contrary, Phil Foden, often stationed as a right-winger (occasionally drifting centrally), enjoys greater creative freedom to roam across the field. His prowess lies in his exceptional passing ability, adept ball-carrying skills, and impeccable first touch.

Conversely, Gvardiol adopts a more defensive stance as a left-back, owing to Akanji's movement from left center-back into the midfield to generate overloads. Consequently, Grealish is positioned wider to maintain the team's structural integrity. This setup hinges on the presence of a player capable of holding a wide position and proficient in dribbling. The strategic configuration guarantees the presence of at least one player on the flanks to stretch the opposing defense. This strategic alignment exemplifies Pep's targeted player profile, substantiated by City's investment of £100 million in acquiring Grealish. The deployment of a traditional right-back like Kyle Walker serves to facilitate Phil Foden's inward movement, showcasing the tactical ingenuity of the setup.

In their possession phase, Manchester City's configuration involves Rodri situated ahead of Dias and Gvardiol, with the understanding that he slightly tucks in due to Akanji's midfield involvement. On the opposite side of Rodri, Kovacic holds his position, effectively forming a box shape. Notably, instances arise when Rodri, Akanji, and Kovacic all converge in the midfield, positioned in front of Dias and Gvardiol. This fluid movement produces a 2-3 defensive shape, furnishing a robust foundation for Phil Foden's inward movement. In this framework, Alvarez assumes the role of a left attacking midfielder, while Kyle Walker and Grealish contribute width from the flanks. This structural arrangement orchestrates Haaland's calculated positioning, wherein he awaits the opportune moment for the final touch finish. Moreover, Haaland's presence ensures a dual purpose – he keeps both center-backs engaged, thereby generating space for occasional late runs from the midfield. 

A critical observation to glean from the heat maps is the remarkable positional discipline exhibited by Manchester City's players.

<h2>Liverpool</h2>

While Manchester City perfectly blends total football and tiki-taka, shifting the opposition's defensive structure laterally to carve out openings in the center, Liverpool opts for a more direct approach. The Reds swiftly deliver passes upfield, with Alexander-Arnold and Robertson embarking on dynamic runs to provide early crosses. Meanwhile, Salah and Diogo Jota capitalize on spaces created when one drops into a False 9 role. Liverpools structure relies on having full backs who run up and down the field. However, we are now seeing Alexander-Arnold adopt a more central position. 


![l](/red-army-recaps/assets/midfield_shape/liverpool.jpg)

Historically, Liverpool has favored an assertive midfield setup comprising a defensive midfielder (CDM) and two box-to-box players on either side, all possessing adept passing skills. This configuration demands swift ground coverage from the box-to-box players, while the CDM holds a central position in front of the center-backs. In their current lineup, Mac Allister mirrors Fabinho's role, with Gapko and Szobozlai as left and right-sided number 8s respectively. The absence of a traditional number 10 is offset by Jota, who frequently drops into that area, creating space for Dias and Salah to exploit. Comparing heat maps of Phil Foden and Salah reveals that Salah's movement is more disciplined in terms of positioning. Both Salah and Dias tend to make inward runs, resulting in minimal activity near the byline compared to players like Grealish or Saka. Robertson and Alexander-Arnold often provide clipped balls for Salah and Dias or early crosses, capitalizing on Jota's positional play. Notably, Jota's ability to head the ball effectively is intriguing given his shorter stature.

In the grand scheme of things, as Alexander-Arnold shifts towards the center, Szobozlai assumes wider positions on the field in contrast to Gapko, which is clearly illustrated by the heatmap. This arrangement establishes balance on the right-hand side. Gapko's role resembles that of a conventional left midfielder, given Robertson's role in maintaining width. As a result, Gapko operates more centrally, allowing Robertson the freedom to exploit the available space along the flanks.

<h2>Arsenal</h2>

Arteta previously served as an Assistant Coach under Pep Guardiola for a considerable period before assuming the managerial position at Arsenal. It's evident that Arsenal has been influenced by the Manchester City style of play. After Arteta's departure from City, there was a noticeable shift initiated by Pep, where center-backs were increasingly involved in midfield play.

Arteta's tactical preference involves maintaining the original positioning of the center-backs while having one of the fullbacks, like Zinchenko, adopt an inverted role. However, with the introduction of players like Declan Rice and Timber, the fullbacks at Arsenal have been less inclined to invert and are less active in making overlapping runs. This adjustment could signify a strategic evolution in Arteta's approach.

![arsenal](/red-army-recaps/assets/midfield_shape/arsenal.jpg)

Declan Rice typically adopts a deep positioning or shifts out to receive the ball, showcasing his involvement in build-up play. In contrast, Havertz enjoys a more flexible role on the field, granting him freedom in his positioning. Timber or Tomiyasu often position themselves closer to the halfway line, and from there, they attempt to progress by either carrying the ball forward or delivering passes to central zones.

A noteworthy tactic emerges with Partey, who has been utilized as a right-back. This deployment affords him additional creative liberty, allowing him to explore central areas, given the proficiency of Saka and Odegaard in ball possession. The strategy carries an element of risk, especially if Saka's style mirrored that of Antony, who tends to be less careful with ball control. The midfield setup has taken on a fresh configuration, requiring a period of observation to fully comprehend their dynamics. Currently, it appears that Rice assumes a deeper position to receive the ball, rather than positioning himself between the lines, which might not yet align with his strengths. Rice's proficiency lies in his passing abilities and ball-carrying skills, possibly prompting Arteta to instruct him to receive the ball from a deeper position on the field. I need more games to understand their setup better.

<h2>Chelsea</h2>

Pochettino has predominantly favored a 3-4-3 formation. During his time at Spurs, he deployed Eric Dier, Vertonghen, and Alderweireld as the central back three, complemented by wingbacks Danny Rose and Kyle Walker. Similarly, Disasi, Silva and Colwell play as the back 3 with Chilwell and James or Gusto. Wingbacks play a key role in this system as they have to contribute a lot more in buildup play. Chilwell is probably one of the best left wingbacks but I wouldn't say that if were deployed in a back 4. 

![chelsea](/red-army-recaps/assets/midfield_shape/chelsea.jpg)

In Chelsea's midfield setup, the dynamic duo of Conor Gallagher and Caicedo play a crucial role as engines. Their responsibilities include extensive running to cover spaces due to the advanced positioning of the wingbacks in the system. To illustrate, if we compare Chilwell's heatmap with that of other fullbacks, the disparity in advanced positioning becomes evident.

Enzo, part of the front three, frequently drops deeper to facilitate link-up play. In contrast, Sterling, his counterpart on the opposite flank, maintains a higher and wider position on the pitch, often taking on defenders. This variance in positioning influences the roles of the surrounding players. Chilwell is inclined to push up since Enzo's positioning is more central, while Gusto exercises more caution in venturing forward compared to Chilwell, as reflected in the heatmap. This strategic alignment generates a harmonious balance across the entire field of play.

<h2>Manchester United</h2>

Manchester United fielded a midfield trio of Casemiro, Eriksen, and Bruno in a recent match. Since Eriksen's comeback from injury, his performance hasn't been as sharp, indicating a potential decrease in his pace and overall form. In light of this, Eric Ten Hag, the manager, decided to focus on acquiring a box-to-box midfielder during the summer transfer window.

However, the choice to sign Mount instead of Ambrabat for this role has raised eyebrows and garnered interest. Given that Manchester United usually maintains higher possession rates in their matches, having a midfielder with a more offensive mindset aligns logically. Mount's profile fits this requirement well, as he not only contributes to attacking efforts but also demonstrates a willingness to engage in lengthy recovery runs back into the defensive zone. 

![mu](/red-army-recaps/assets/midfield_shape/man_utd.jpg)

Mount's touchmap closely resembles Havertz's, suggesting a shared playing style. However, Bruno's touchmap is different from Odegaard's, contributing to a notable issue. Deploying two central midfielders with a penchant for attacking play and the liberty to roam can lead to complications. Such a strategy might be viable if the defensive midfielder assumes a deeper role and has speed to recover in case the opposition counter attacks. Casemiro's recent displays have shown signs of fatigue. This tactical approach might prove ineffective against stronger teams. Instead, a defensive-minded number 8, characterized by discipline, could be essential, allowing Bruno to thrive in a liberated attacking midfielder role. The full-back positioned on the side opposite to the ongoing attack takes on an inverted role to provide additional coverage in the midfield region. This strategic adjustment contributes to a more well-rounded defensive setup while maintaining offensive potential.

Regrettably, this strategy has faced setbacks as the three midfielders are still learning to sync their playing styles. Improved positional discipline is necessary for Bruno and Mount. Moreover, Casemiro's slow start has compounded the situation. As familiarity and adaptation develop, the midfield coordination could eventually improve. Antony, Rashford and Garnacho, all have to start looking after the ball better if this midfield is to work. 

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

Both Manchester City and Chelsea exhibit the most coherent touch heatmaps, making it straightforward to explain their strategies and observe their implementation in the heatmap data. Liverpool, too, boasts a distinct style of play, although examining Mac Allister's heatmap highlights a potential need for a defensive midfielder.

Arsenal's midfield presents a puzzle that requires additional time for comprehension. Similar to Manchester United, they seem to face challenges, but they are making progress. A factor contributing to this improvement is Rice's greater mobility in comparison to Casemiro, while Saka's confident ball possession sets him apart from Antony. I often find myself wishing for a day when I can easily articulate our team's playing style. Strangely, the team I closely follow is the one I understand the least about. Grasping their tactics and patterns remains a challenge.
