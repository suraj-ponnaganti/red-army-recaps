The opening match against Wolves was a disappointment for fans. Every United supporter likely finished the game with a sigh, possibly telling their partners, "Babe, we survived!" It's not the sentiment you want to have as a United fan, especially against Wolves, a team considered a potential relegation candidate by pundits. I was hoping for an improved performance with some changes to the starting 11. I tempered my expectations due to Spurs' first game, where I was impressed by Bissouma and Sarr's ground coverage. Our midfield had appeared vulnerable against Wolves. 

<h2>Match stats</h2>

Spurs enjoyed more possession at 56%, and both teams registered 6 shots on target. Spurs completed around 100 more passes due to their greater possession. In terms of tackling success against dribblers, United won approximately 38% while Spurs won about 47%, as per the FBRef [report](https://fbref.com/en/squads/19538871/2023-2024/matchlogs/c9/defense/Manchester-United-Match-Logs-Premier-League).

<h2>Spurs' shape</h2>

In this setup, Spurs' RB Pedro Porro and LB Destiny Udogie tuck into the midfield with Yves Bissouma positioned in the center. This arrangement provides them the opportunity to keep Sarr and Maddison higher up the pitch. However, United effectively employed shadow marking on the fullbacks when one of the CBs had possession. Bruno marked Bissouma, Rashford pressed the goalkeeper to keep the play on one side. Mount and Casemiro covered Sarr and Maddison, with Mount often positioned between Sarr and Pedro Porro, ready to apply pressure when needed.

<h2>Shadow Marking worked!... almost</h2>

Shadow marking involves pressing a player or positioning yourself between two players to cut off passing lanes. This can be challenging to execute effectively as the player you're marking is likely to move (unless it's McTominay). In the image below, Garnacho is shadow marking by positioning himself to cut off the passing lane between Romero and Porro, compelling the goalkeeper to pass to Porro. Mount anticipates this pass and quickly applies pressure, leading to a turnover.

The turnover leads to a high shot from Antony, which is acceptable. However, I am concerned about Mount's choice to enter the box after winning the ball and passing it to Garnacho. His closeness to Bruno makes it a redundant option, especially considering Garnacho and Antony's carelessness in possession. Mount should adopt a more conservative approach in his runs.

<h2>First promising opportunity</h2>

The scenario shown in the image below resembles a [chance](https://suraj-ponnaganti.github.io/red-army-recaps/2023/08/18/UnitedVsWolves.html) we had against Wolves. However, images can be deceptive. The space between Mount and the retreating Sarr was rapidly diminishing. Ideally, Antony should have attempted a pass to Mount, even though it might have been a challenging one. This action could have resulted in a 4 vs. 3 advantage for United.

However, he opts to switch it wide to Garnacho. The chosen pass is a lofted cross and placed behind Garnacho. Garnacho possesses speed and there's an available space ahead of him. Mount moves forward, which is acceptable considering Bruno's presence in the midfield. Shaw makes an overlaping run, but Garnacho delivers a sloppy pass that gets intercepted, leading to a corner kick.

In a different play, shortly after, Antony could have chosen to pass to Bruno for a reset, but he opted to dribble past Bissouma, leading to a loss of possession. Antony's tendency for risky decisions on the ball, as seen in the previous game and last season, might become an issue without a defensively oriented midfielder.

<h2>Mount was brilliant in the first half</h2>

Mount's first-half performance was impressive. The image below demonstrates a prime instance: Casemiro shifted towards the right to cover the wing as AWB was retreating. This strategic move is akin to selecting 'cover wing' for the CDM in FIFA. Mount positioned himself centrally and deeper, effectively intercepting Richarlison's advance after he beat Casemiro, with AWB claiming the lose ball and passing it to Bruno.

The following image holds significant importance, embodying Eric Ten Hag's concept of transitional moments. Spurs' shape mirrors the earlier in-possession structure discussed, leaving room wide due to tucked-in fullbacks. Bruno locates Garnacho, prompting quick coverage by Sarr and Porro.

Shaw executes a dynamic overlap, drawing Sarr deeper and creating a pathway for Bruno, who delivers an audacious rabona cross.

Here's another instance of our midfield trio displaying excessive eagerness to press, resulting in significant gaps behind them. At this level, most players excel in one-on-one situations. Allowing opponents to build speed and charge at you, particularly in midfield, becomes problematic as they can distribute to either side. Covering such extensive space is indeed challenging, and the primary approach is to continually retreat until you notice the player's head dropping as they prepare to take a shot.

![mount](/red-army-recaps/assets/spurs_away_wk_2/mount_4.jpg) 

Mount's exceptional endurance allowed him to cover the entire pitch and execute a last-minute challenge to block Sarr's shot.

<h2>Why so tired?</h2>

Casemiro receives a pass and attempts to cross the ball into the box. It's the right idea, given Rashford and Bruno's positions between Romero and Porro, with Garnacho on Porro's blindside. However, the attempt appears tired, resulting in a scuffed pass. Note Son!

![leggy](/red-army-recaps/assets/spurs_away_wk_2/leggy.jpg) 

Within 8 seconds, Son and Maddison had passed Casemiro. While Bruno was in the box attempting to receive the cross, Mount was positioned near the edge of the box. The midfield triangle was well-formed. However, Casemiro needed to quickly sprint back after losing the ball, especially considering he saw Son and Maddison running past him.

<h2>First goal</h2>

The first image is the outcome of a poor pass from Garnacho, leading to a turnover. At this point, Maddison can slip the ball to Son. Martinez is playing him onside, but he doesn't check. He sees Varane and assumes Son is offside. Martinez does slow down and keeps Son offside a few seconds later.

![goal](/red-army-recaps/assets/spurs_away_wk_2/goal_1.jpg) 

Maddison then passes the ball into the midfield, and they switch the play to Kulusevski. As shown in the image, Shaw checks his shoulder and realizes that the only threat is already marked. He should step out to Kulusevski because Garnacho will never catch up. Instead, he decides to stay compact and let Kulusevski drive to the byline.

![goal](/red-army-recaps/assets/spurs_away_wk_2/goal_2.jpg) 

Casemiro, Varane, Martinez, and Shaw are all marking pretty much the same space. Bruno sees Sarr but doesn't track him or even communicate with Casemiro, asking him to check his shoulder. This leads to the goal!

<h2>Second goal</h2>

This goal start from a good pass. Before this play, Casemiro was dragged wide by a runner which left some space in the middle. Romero plays a perfect pass and Son plays it back to Maddison who then switches it wide to Perisic. 

![goal](/red-army-recaps/assets/spurs_away_wk_2/goal2_1.jpg) 

Both Varane and Eriksen can see Davis open. Instead of sprinting to cover the pass, they jog, which leads to a scuffed shot by Davis. Martinez accidentally plays it in.

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

Casemiro, Antony, Garnacho, Shaw, Rashford, and Martinez have all performed poorly in the last two games. However, I'm not overly concerned about Casemiro, Martinez, and Shaw, as I believe they will bounce back. Casemiro needs to adapt and understand Mount's limitations. I recall Casemiro starting slowly last season too, making some mistakes against Everton which led to a goal but then delivering a superb pass to Ronaldo. Martinez just needs a boost in confidence, and Shaw has faced similar situations in the past.

Antony and Garnacho's poor decision making is a concern for me. Antony has done nothing so far to show he has worked on his weak foot and is easily marked by full backs. Garnacho needs to come off the bench. 

For our defense to improve, it's crucial for Mount and Bruno to track runners effectively. Their role should involve sticking to their respective sides during possession, transitioning to a 10 role when the ball is on their side, and then shifting to an 8 position when the ball is on the opposite side. I am confident that ETH will make changes next game and bring solidarity in the midfield.
